#Edited code frorm Eric Anderson
## Make a pedigree figure with all of the 5-generation individuals

I think the way we are going to want to do this is to find all the individuals
that are on a 6-generation path.  We will color those in a certain color.  If any
of those individuals have only one parent on the path, then we should have the other parent as 
well, but not grandparents, etc.   We will plot  these with my 'pedvis' package.  This relies on
GraphViz (I think you can do "brew install graphviz" on the terminal to get that.)  
Then, get the package with:
```{r}
#remotes::install_github("eriqande/pedvis")
library(pedvis)
simple_test_ped()
```

### Find all individuals on a 6-generation path

I think we can do this just by 
```{r}
six_path_func <- function(x) {
  z <- all_shortest_paths(graph, from = x, to = founders, mode = "out")$res
  z[sapply(z, length) >= 7]
}

six_path_tibble <- tibble(kids = kiddos) %>%
  mutate(path_lists = map(.x = kids, .f = six_path_func)) %>%
  mutate(plength = map_int(path_lists, length)) %>%
  filter(plength > 0)
  
```
There are 49 paths of length >= 6 generations.  We obviously want to have any individuals explicitly on
such a path in the pedigree (colored gray). But, we also should have any immediate parents of them that are not on the path
as unshaded nodes.  That will
make a nice plot, I think.  It might still be too many individuals to make a nice pedigree, but let's go for it.

For what we need to do, it will suffice to just have a vector of individuals on those paths, so
let's get those:
```{r}
on_path_ids <- lapply(six_path_tibble$path_lists, function(x) unique(names(unlist(x)))) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unique()

```
That is 162 individuals.  OK.

Now, we just filter our metadata/pedigree table to offspring that are amongst these 162
individuals:
```{r}
fish_for_big_ped <- as_tibble(Ped_length_age) %>%
  filter(kid %in% on_path_ids)
```

### Plot those with Pedvis

Now that we have all those fish, we can prep them for pedvis.

It looks like we just need a Kid Pa Ma data frame:
```{r}
pped <- fish_for_big_ped %>%
  select(kid, pa, ma)

ped_dump <- ped2dot(x = pped, pa = "pa", ma = "ma", kid = "kid",
        ObsNodes = on_path_ids, 
        outf = "6-gen-paths-ped",
        pfactorNodeStyle = "invis",
        pfactorEdgeStyle = "invis"
        )
  
```

The picture we want is in `6-gen-paths-ped.pdf`.


let's try 3 geneartions: 
###
{r, eval=FALSE}
three_path_func <- function(x) {
  z <- all_shortest_paths(graph, from = x, to = founders, mode = "out")$res
  z[sapply(z, length) >= 4]
}

three_path_tibble <- tibble(kids = kiddos) %>%
  mutate(path_lists = map(.x = kids, .f = three_path_func)) %>%
  mutate(plength = map_int(path_lists, length)) %>%
  filter(plength > 0)
on_path_ids <- lapply(three_path_tibble$path_lists, function(x) unique(names(unlist(x)))) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unique()
fish_for_big_ped <- as_tibble(Ped_length_age) %>%
  filter(kid %in% on_path_ids)
pped <- fish_for_big_ped %>%
  select(kid, pa, ma)

ped_dump <- ped2dot(x = pped, pa = "pa", ma = "ma", kid = "kid",
        ObsNodes = on_path_ids, 
        outf = "3-gen-paths-ped",
        pfactorNodeStyle = "invis",
        pfactorEdgeStyle = "invis"
        )
